# snake
Command Line Snake Game! By using asdw controls (and pushing enter between each move)(for now) you can play Snake! Clone the repository, type `dotnet run` in your command line, after you've navigated to the project file of course, and away you go!

I do recommend shrinking your window size to something like 46x13 as it is distracting to see every rendering. A smaller window will make the snake appear to move smoothly and be easier to use.
